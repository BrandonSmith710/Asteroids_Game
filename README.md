# Asteroids_Game
This is a remake of the arcade game Asteroids coded in Python.

To install and play the game, you first must clone this repository to your local system. Next you will need to ensure that pygame has been installed using pip. 
Then using an IDE such as Idle or Sublime, run the main.py script. A new window will open and the game will begin within a few seconds, where you can exit out of the application at any time.
